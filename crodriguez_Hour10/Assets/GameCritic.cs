/* In my opinion, the game is easy to play

I will make the game harder by adding some obstacles in the terrain like holes that will make the game restart or take a ball out of the goal areas

I think music and some explosion effects from the collision of the chaos balls will add  the WOW factor to the game.


The fun parts of the game are to see the objects just working in the scene and the interaction between them. The challenging part is to keep track of the components and where they go, especially the scripts. I am glad the book provided the scripts for the game objects. */



/*Suggestions: For this project Hour -10 I tried to add a timer and start button, but it didn't work since I kept missing names and labels of the variables. Another suggestion that I used and worked was adding the extra chaos balls with transparent material and different sizes. I also changed the shape of the bumper and created a casserole shape instead.
 I feel like I spent more time trying to make the timer and start button work. In the end, I ran out of time to make other changes in the game like adding sound.*/
